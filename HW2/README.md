1. Clone the repo into your local machine or download a zip file of the entire project.
2. After cloning or extracting the zip file, in HW2\src folder, you should find a project file HW2.sln.
3. Open HW2.sln (solution file) in Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution. Once build completed, you should see HW2.exe executable file in the same directory.
5. Finally, run HW2.exe executable file. Make sure input file is also in the same directory. It will produce an output image (TeapPot.bmp) in the same folder.
